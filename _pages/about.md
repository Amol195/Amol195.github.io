I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/) for the Advanced Data Analytics (ADA) Team. My current areas of work are around Customer/Marketing, Pricing and Supply Chain Analytics. In 2019, I graduated with a Masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering from [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/) wherein my focus was mainly on Machine Learning, Statistics and Signal Processing. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's Degree at [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/) in Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering, during which I was involved in working for [CoE-CNDS](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html). I enjoy playing chess, reading books and cooking mainly during my free time.

Areas of Interest
======

My areas of interests primarily lie in Machine Learning, Big Data, Statistical Learning. My inclination towards Machine Learning stems from a keen interest in Mathematics and Statistics and then Signal Processing during my undergraduate studies. I love reading various tech articles in order to keep myself updated in this rapidly changing field. I am mainly focused on getting exposed to applying ML in a set of diverse problems in an industrial setting wherein both research and deployment come into play.
