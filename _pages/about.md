I am a Data Scientist at [Stanley Black and Decker](https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/) in the Data and Analytics Team. Recently, I graduated with a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/), wherein my specialization was in Signal Processing, Machine Learning. Before that, I did my Bachelors of Technology in Electronics and Telecommunications from [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), during which I was involved in working for [Centre of Excellence in Complex and Non-Linear Dynamical Systems, VJTI](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html).

Areas of Interest
======

My areas of interests primarily lie in Machine Learning, Big Data, Statistical Learning. My inclination towards Machine Learning stems from a keen interest in Mathematics and Statistics and then Signal Processing during my undergraduate studies. I love reading various tech articles in order to keep myself updated in this rapidly changing field. I am mainly focused on getting exposed to applying ML in a set of diverse problems in an industrial setting wherein both research and deployment come into play.
