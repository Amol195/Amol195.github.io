I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/) in the Advanced Data Analytics (ADA) Team, and pursuing certifications mainly on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Statistical Learning.  In 2019, I graduated with a Masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering from [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/) wherein my focus was mainly on Machine Learning, Statistics and Signal Processing. My Bachelor's Degree was in Electronics & Telecommunications at [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), during which I was involved in various research projects under [Dr. Faruk Kazi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=oa7QCAgAAAAJ&hl=en).

Areas of Interest
======

As a Data Scientist, my work areas revolve around Pricing, Marketing & Customer Analytics. I enjoy working on initiatives which have a visible impact on customers, in addition to constantly trying out new backend frameworks to deliver data-driven insights. My passion for Data Science stems mainly from statistics and also that I love handling big data! Most of the time you would find me exploring & testing new learning frameworks in different business areas, thus improving my business domain knowledge as well as the technical stack.

Get in Touch
======

I do look forward to talk with you and explore any potential collaboration in competitions ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for example). You can message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amolsingbal/), where we can discuss more about the same.

Hobbies
======

You would find me mainly reading during my free time! I have developed some interest in physics(mainly relativity and some astrophysics) to understand more about our universe. Here's a [fun page](https://neal.fun/size-of-space/) which got me interested, along with Stephen Hawking's famous book ([A Brief History of Time](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0553380168)). Other than physics, I keep myself updated in reading about finance, world politics and tech news. I also hold a Black Belt in [Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan), which I practice for fun at times :)
