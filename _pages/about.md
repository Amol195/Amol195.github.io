I am an Electronics, Electrical and Computer Engineer by Formal Education, and I like to believe myself to be a budding Engineering Mathematician by passion. I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), Atlanta with specialization in Digital Signal Processing. Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering (Institute Gold Medal) from [VJTI](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), Mumbai. I am, however, still passively affiliated to the [Center of Excellence (CoE) in Complex and Non-Linear Dynamical Systems (CNDS)](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html), VJTI.

As a background context, I am aggressively protective of my time, as I believe we all should be. As a researcher and a developer, I wear the hat of a maker. [Here](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) is an excellent essay about why disruptions are corrosive to a maker's schedule.


Research Interests
======

 My research is focussed at the intersection of Statistical Learning, Optimization and Signal Processing; and I love to think about the Design & Analysis of Algorithms. My prime hobby is ‘Thinking’ and I like to model real-life scenarios to find their solutions through Mathematics (for e.g. The Linear Inverse Problem Theory relates to how Humans perceive each other). I also like to think about the fusion of Machine Learning and Game Theory, as both these model the most supreme agents we live with; the former created by Humans while the later created out of Natural Science! 

If any of the above interests you, I am looking forward to talking to you. If you've read this, I already like you!
