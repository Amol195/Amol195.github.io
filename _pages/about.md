Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) advised by [Nadia Polikarpova](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/). I am a member of the [Programming Systems](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) group.
I graduated from BITS Pilani, Goa with an Electronics Bachelor's degree in Fall 2017. Following my graduation, I worked as a research assistant in the [Software Technology Group](https://softech.informatik.uni-kl.de/homepage/en/) at [TU Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/en/home/).<br/>
Previously, I participated in the [December 2015 - March 2016 round](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/2015/DecemberMarch) of [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) working on Staging driver cleanup with Linux Foundation.

Research Interests
======

I am interested in programming languages and formal methods research, with an emphasis on automated program synthesis and verification techniques. My goal is to develop synthesis tools and apply the techniques to various domains such as Human-computer interaction and Linguistics.

Diversity Activities
======

I am currently serving as one of the [Outreachy coordinators](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/linux-kernel/coordinator/preview/shraddha96/) for Linux kernel! I also served on the review committee for the _open source track_ of [GHC 2017](https://ghc.anitab.org/2017-connect-with-abi/ghc-17-committees/) and [GHC 2018](https://ghc.anitab.org/2018-connect/ghc-18-committees/).
