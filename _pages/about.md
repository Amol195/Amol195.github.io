I am a Data Scientist at [Stanley Black and Decker](https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/) in the Data and Analytics Team. Recently, I graduated with a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/), wherein my specialization was in Signal Processing, Machine Learning. Before that, I did my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), during which I was involved in working for [Centre of Excellence in Complex and Non-Linear Dynamical Systems, VJTI](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html).

Research Interests
======

My research areas lie in Statistical Learning, Optimization, Causal Inference & Bioinformatics; and I love to think about the Design & Analysis of Algorithms. My prime hobby is ‘Thinking’ and I like to model real-life scenarios to find their solutions through Mathematics (for e.g. The Linear Inverse Problem Theory relates to how Humans perceive each other). I also like to think about the fusion of Machine Learning and Game Theory, as both these model the most supreme agents we live with; the former created by Humans while the later created out of Bio-Science!

Get in Touch
======

As a background context, I am <b><i>aggressively</i></b> protective of my time, as I believe all of us should be. I love to wear the hats of both a researcher and a developer. [Here's](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) an interesting perspective on why disruptions are so corrosive to a maker's schedule. If you want to chat with me, please consider e-mailing me first for context, and then using [this](https://calendly.com/nishant-keni) to find a time that works best for us. 

If there's anything you believe I can assist you with, I am looking forward to talking to you!
