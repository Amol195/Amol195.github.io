Implemented a PD Controlled Quadcopter for agricultural, military and natural calamity surveillance. The Quadcopter used
Graph Theory for trajectory planning, SLAM for field exploration and Computer Vision for anomalous activity detection. The
Quadcopter also contained a Remote Sensing system for soil and forest cover identification using statistical learning models.
