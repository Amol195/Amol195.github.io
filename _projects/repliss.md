Repliss is a verification system for checking correctness of applications built on top of weakly consistent distributed databases such as [Antidote](http://syncfree.github.io/antidote/). In case of a network failure in a replicated database or concurrent updates across different data centers, conflict resolution data types help resolve conflicts across different replicas. Replicated data types ensure that the replicas have same state, once they have received the same set of update operations. <br/>
